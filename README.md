# Image Classification with MNIST and CIFAR

## Overview

This project is a deep dive into the fundamentals of image classification, using two well-known datasets: MNIST and CIFAR. The primary motivation behind this project is to build a strong foundation in computer vision, focusing on image classification through hands-on experience with neural networks.

By working with these datasets, I aim to improve my understanding of both feedforward neural networks and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are essential tools in the field of deep learning and image processing.

## What's Inside

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that guide you through the process of solving image classification problems with two different approaches:

- **MNIST with Feedforward Neural Networks**: A notebook that demonstrates how to solve the MNIST digit classification problem using a simple feedforward neural network.
- **CIFAR-10 with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: A notebook that tackles the CIFAR-10 image classification problem using a CNN, showcasing the power of convolutional layers in handling more complex image data.

Each notebook is structured to not only present the code but also explain the underlying concepts, making it easier to understand the implementation details.

## Setup

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Follow the instructions below to set up the environment and start exploring the notebooks.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry installed on your system

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nvan21/Image-Classification-Tutorials
   cd Image-Classification-Tutorials
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies as specified in the `pyproject.toml` file

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```
   
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
